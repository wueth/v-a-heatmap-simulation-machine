# v-a-heatmap-simulation-machine
We provide an R code that allows to simulate (synthetic) v-a heatmaps of individual car drivers in the speed bucket (5,20]km/h. This simulation machine is based on a neural network architecture which has been calibrated to real GPS car driving data. The scale has been chosen rather coarse for computational reasons.
